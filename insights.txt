Cybersecurity SOC Intelligence – Key Insights

1.  Overall Cyber Posture

-   Total Cyber Attacks recorded: 6000
-   High Severity Attacks: 1782 (29.7% of total)
-   Attack Growth increased significantly year-over-year (122% growth).
-   Risk Severity Score indicates elevated enterprise exposure.

2.  Attack Pattern Intelligence

-   DDoS is the dominant attack vector (35.7% of total incidents).
-   Phishing contributes 7.2% of attacks.
-   Critical and Severe attacks together represent nearly 30% of all
    incidents.
-   DDoS generates the highest packet and data transfer volume.
-   Impact and Reconnaissance tactics dominate MITRE tactic mapping.

3.  Geographic Risk Exposure

-   High concentration of attacks observed across North America, Europe,
    and Asia.
-   Threat distribution suggests globally distributed attack sources.

4.  System & Infrastructure Risk

-   Firewall Appliance and Cloud VM Instances are the most targeted
    assets.
-   Web-based systems show higher exposure risk.
-   Business Criticality Index indicates high-value infrastructure under
    frequent attack.
-   Risk Score across systems remains consistently elevated.

5.  Incident Response Performance

-   Mean Time To Detect (MTTD): 7.43 minutes.
-   Mean Time To Respond (MTTR): 39.35 minutes.
-   Escalation Rate: 67.45% (high operational workload).
-   Closed Incident Rate: ~49.9%.
-   Root causes mainly linked to Credential Leaks and Configuration
    Weakness.

6.  SOC Operational Observations

-   Escalation Levels are evenly distributed, indicating consistent
    multi-tier handling.
-   Open incidents remain high, indicating need for improved response
    automation.
-   Critical Resolution Time remains elevated compared to overall
    average response time.

Conclusion: The enterprise faces significant DDoS-driven threat activity
with high criticality exposure across core infrastructure systems. While
detection time is efficient, response time and escalation rate indicate
operational strain. Enhanced automation, stronger credential management,
and firewall hardening are recommended.
